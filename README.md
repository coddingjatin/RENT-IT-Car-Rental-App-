# 🚗 RENT-IT – Car Rental Management System (Java)

**RENT-IT** is a feature-rich Java-based Car Rental Application designed to manage car bookings with ease for both **customers** and **admins**. It allows customers to register, search, rent, and return cars, while admins manage the fleet, track rentals, and generate bills.  

This project is a real-world simulation of a car rental business, built with clean code and a strong focus on user interaction.
